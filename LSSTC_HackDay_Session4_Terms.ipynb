    "- **Frequientist Approach** - Looking at probabilites based on the frequency of an event. Models are constants while data vary. \n",
    "- **Bayesian Approach** - A statistical method that uses previous knowledge of an event. Bayesian probability is a meausure certainty about a how a model fits the data. In the Bayesian approach data are constants and models vary.\n",
    "- **prior** - A proablility distribution chosen *before* you do anything. This distribution is based on what you know about the data. --insert figure--\n",
    "- **posterior** - The probablity of the parameter(s) that you are interested in, given an event. [Posterior Example](#Posterior_Likelihood_example_cell) \n",
    "- **likelihood** - The probablity of an event given some parameters. [Likelihood Example](#Posterior_Likelihood_example_cell) \n",
    "- **marginalize** - Integrate over a variable [When to do this](#Billards_example)\n",
    "- **hyper-parameters** - Parameters from your prior distribution (the distribution based on what you knew about the data)\n",
    "- **population paramter** - A statistic, such as the mean or varience, used to desrcibe a population \n",
    "- **latent variables** - Variables that are not directly observed. These variables are infered through your model.\n",
    "- **nusiance parameter** - A parameter that you don't care about but needs to be accounted for in the analysis of the parameters you care about. [Nuisance Parameter Example](#Billards_example)\n",
    "- **confiedence interval** - When you compute a true value from data of *this* particular type, the true value should fall within this interval. (Key! data of *this* kind!!!!!)\n",
    "- **crediable region** - Given the *observed* data, this is the region where the true value should fall.\n",
    "- **sampling** - Picking random values based on a distribution\n",
    "- **Chi Square test** - A way to determine if two variables are independent of one another\n",
    "- **covarience** - How much two random variable vary together\n",
    "- **deterministic** - not random\n",
    "- **stochastic** - determined randomly\n",
    "- **least-squares fit** - Fitting a line where you minimize the difference between the observed value and the model value\n",
    "- **k$_\\sigma$ clipping** - A method to remove outlying points [K_sigma Example](#K_sigma)\n",
    "- **Gaussian Process** - A model where observations occur in a continuous domain. Every point is associated with a normally distributed random variable.\n",
    "- **kernel** - The form of the probability distribution where factors, such as a normalization factor, that aren't functions of the variable(s) of intest are dropped. [Kernel Example](#Kernel)\n",
    "- **predictive distribution**\n",
    "- **MCMC** seperate into two terms??\n",
